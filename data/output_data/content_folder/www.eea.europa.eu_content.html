The EEA has published the first ever <strong><a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/european-climate-risk-assessment" rel="noopener">European Climate Risk Assessment (EUCRA)</a></strong> to help identify policy priorities for climate change adaptation and for climate-sensitive sectors.</p><p>According to the assessment, Europe’s policies and adaptation actions are not keeping pace with the rapidly growing risks.
