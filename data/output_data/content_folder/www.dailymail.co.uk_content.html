        A 14-year-old boy has been killed and four injured in a 'terrifying sword attack' in east London this morning. Two police officers and three members of the public were rushed to hospital after reports a car had driven into a home in Hainault , east London , shortly before 7am on Tuesday. Metropolitan Police confirmed in a statement this afternoon that one of the people injured in the attack has since died. Horrifying footage posted on social media appears to show a sword-wielding suspect wearing a yellow hoodie as he prowled the streets and crouched beside homes. Metropolitan Police later confirmed a 36-year-old man had been arrested. They are not looking for more suspects in relation to the ordeal and the attack 'does not appear to be terror-related', police said.

       Two police officers and three members of the public were rushed to hospital after reports a car had driven into a home in Hainault , shortly before 7am on Tuesday. The Metropolitan Police later confirmed a 13-year-old boy died had in hospital and the two officers will require surgery for serious injuries. Footage captured moments before police arrested a 36-year-old man, shows the knife wielding thug, dressed in a yellow hoodie, stood on top of a garage roof before entering a resident's garden. The terrifying scenes were recorded by a member of the public, who can be heard desperately warning people to 'lock your doors' while officers scramble to subdue the man and prevent him injuring anyone else.

                King Charles bravely continued his own cancer treatment today after meeting patients on a chemotherapy ward in hospital as he returned to public-facing duties. The monarch appeared relaxed and in good spirits during a visit to University College Hospital Macmillan Cancer Centre in London, where he sat down to chat to those receiving chemotherapy and told them he was 'well', 'alright' and 'not too bad'. Charles was joined by Queen Camilla during the trip and they went on a number of impromptu walkabouts, meeting staff who stopped to catch a glimpse of the couple. The King looked overjoyed to be back today for the first time since his cancer diagnosis, smiling and holding the hands of patients on the chemotherapy ward. The development indicated the positive progress Charles is making after almost three months of cancer care as an outpatient. When quizzed about his health, the head of state told one patient: 'I'm alright thank you very much, not too bad.' The King sympathised with another patient as she was treated in a day unit, telling Lesley Woodbridge, 63: 'I've got to have my treatment this afternoon as well.' Asha Millen, 60, who is receiving chemotherapy for bone marrow cancer, also chatted to the King as he met patients in the chemotherapy day unit. She asked Charles about his own health, saying: 'I said 'how are you?' and he said 'I'm well'.'

        We were told during Covid that Sweden would suffer mass fatalities. Instead, it had one of the lowest excess mortality rates in Europe. Does that not suggest that our response was wrong?

        I was diagnosed with asthma in my late 30s but it was very mild - and came and went - until about five years ago. Then, two years ago, the tightness in my chest and the wheezing worsened.

                There is a man's name in my phone contacts - let's call him Dave - who was once an important person to me but who now refuses to answer my calls. He has seemingly dropped off the face of the planet, except I often see his white van whizzing around the West Sussex city of Chichester where I live, so I know it is actually only me he is trying to avoid. I can't really blame him. He isn't an ex-boyfriend or even a friend for that matter. He's just some poor, unsuspecting bloke who happens to own an extra-long wheelbase Luton van and who once advertised his removals business on Gumtree.

       Footage shows Saltanat Nukenova (left), 31, being brutally beaten by her husband, Kuandyk Bischimbayev (inset), 43, Kazakhstan's former economy minister, in a restaurant belonging to one of his relatives. It was shared during his televised murder trial before the country's Supreme Court , which has shocked the nation, with tens of thousands signing petitions for harsher penalties for domestic violence. Bishimbayev, 43, had claimed in court that his wife had died from 'self-inflicted' injuries on November 9 last year. But the CCTV footage directly contradicts his claim, as it shows the politician punching and kicking his defenceless wife over a period of more than two hours. Bishimbayev finally admitted in court last Wednesday that he had beaten her and 'unintentionally' caused her death.

                An enormous balloon dome, towers of cake, an inflatable slide and a name lit up in LED lights - all put together by a stylist and filmed by a professional videographer. But this wasn't a wedding or a milestone anniversary, it was all to celebrate the fourth birthday of Kyle Walker and Lauryn Goodman's son, Kairo. The youngster's mother hired a team of 14 event coordinators to ensure he had the most lavish children's party ever in true WAG style. In an Instagram post on Monday, Lauryn, 31, (bottom inset with Kairo) shared a video of the day and thanked the team of 14 different party planners that came together for the 'planning and concept' of the day. Kairo's father, Kyle, 33, (top inset) was reportedly missing from his son's birthday amid an ongoing feud with his mother Lauryn.

        Have you ever been on your way to a date and wondered what shirt will look better with your newly-highlighted hair - the emerald green blouse or a banana-yellow one? Color analysis can help with that.

                Prince Julian, the son of Princess Sofia of Sweden and Prince Carl Philip stole the show with his cheeky facial expressions at the Royal Palace for for King Carl XVI Gustaf's birthday in Stockholm today. Julian, the youngest of the eight grandchildren of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia , turned three at the end of March. The young royal sat on his mother's hip as he waved to crowds of well-wishers hoping to catch a glimpse of the King on his 78th birthday. He was joined by his siblings, Prince Alexander, seven, and Prince Gabriel, six, as they clapped, smiled and waved to royal fans. Prince Julian's facial expressions were similar to Prince Louis ' when he was pictured on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to celebrate Trooping the Colour in 2022.

                Hundreds of guests flown out to a remote Scottish island, a dinner of lobster, oysters and local beef, A-listers in attendance, a marching band and a fireworks display to rival most Guy Fawkes nights.... it might sound like a celebrity wedding, but it's in fact the 25th birthday party of Lady Lola Bute. The aristocrat, who is the daughter of the late John Crichton-Stuart, 7th Marquess of Bute and fashion designer Serena Bute, took guests - including Sienna Miller, Charlotte Tilbury and Poppy Delevingne - to her family seat Mount Stuart House on the Isle of Bute in the Scottish Highlands. Once there, well-heeled guests had a weekend-long celebration. They danced in the 19th Century Gothic revival dining hall, they slept in grand bedrooms that look straight out of a fantasy novel. An evening of celebrations simply wasn't enough,  Princess Olympia of Greece , Lady Mary Charteris, danced with members of the Guinness family, who downed Iron Bru in the day before switching to a more sophisticated dirty martini in the evening. Lola is pictured left and right, Poppy centre. Inset guests, including Sienna Miller inside the Manor House

       The 31-year-old Briton reportedly flagged down cabbie Abdullah Saesaheh to take him to the Woraburi Phuket Resort and Spa on the island of Phuket on April 27. However, when they arrived at the hotel, the passenger allegedly handed Abdullah a 100 baht (£2.15) banknote, mistaking it for a 1,000 baht (£21.51) bill to pay for the fare, which came to 400 baht (£8.60). When Abdullah tried to collect the correct amount, the Briton reportedly assaulted him. Shocking dashcam footage shows the tourist, holding a beer bottle in his left hand, strangling Abdullah while repeatedly saying: 'Give me my f****** money'. The frightened Thai native broke free from his grasp and said: 'You paid 100 baht.' However, the passenger insisted: 'No I f****** didn't. I know on my mum's life I f****** didn't. Give me my money. Show me what I paid you with.'

       Considered one of Hitler's right-hand men and the highest-ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg, Reichsmarschall Goring (left) is responsible for some of history's most heinous crimes against humanity. His home in northeastern Poland (right) was considered to have been thoroughly researched, until a team of local researchers and amateur archaeologists set out to uncover a wooden floor in the concrete building. The German-Polish excavators went to the haunting site in the hope of finding some nails or other building materials, and instead uncovered something much darker. The remains of three adults, a teenager and a baby were exposed in the dig, each of which appeared to have been buried naked and had no hands or feet.

                On November 12, 2021, Britney Spears celebrated 'the best day ever' as a judge called an end to her controversial conservatorship.  It marked the end of 14 long years in which Britney's finances, career and personal liberties had been controlled by her father Jamie (right) - a move he insisted was to protect her wellbeing, yet she claimed was 'abusive.'  The 42-year-old Grammy winner had compared being under conservatorship to being a 'sex trafficking victim', detailing that she was made to work against her will, forced into taking birth control and had no control over seeing her sons or friends.  Indeed, having heard Britney's emotive testimony it was hard not to sympathise, after all who would want to think of the princess of pop locked away in an ivory tower with no autonomy? Certainly not the fans who had championed the #FreeBritney campaign (inset, fans at a 2021 rally) and openly wept openly outside the courtroom when her conservatorship was terminated. Yet three years on from the fateful ruling, it's beginning to look like cutting Britney off from her only support system was misguided.

                From basketball training to drama production, home cooking to public speaking, children at All Saints Catholic College will enjoy a whole host of activities when their regular classes finish at 3.15pm. The pilot project, introduced at the Notting Hill school, will see students arrive for breakfast at 7.15am and finish their day with an evening meal and games at around 6.30pm. A total of 120 Year 7 and Year 8 pupils are taking part in the non-compulsory scheme, which is currently running from Monday to Thursday. Headteacher Andrew O'Neill insisted that a 12-hour day will give pupils 'buckets full of endorphins' and aims to break the cycle of smartphone 'addiction'.

       Lali Sokolov encountered Gita Fuhrmannova - the woman who would become his wife - when she stood before him emaciated and robbed of her dignity at Auschwitz death camp. Amidst the evil of the Nazi killing machine, Lali - himself a Jew who had been put to work under threat of death - tattooed a number on her arm like he had done to tens of thousands of people before her. Their ensuing romance was one ray of light that would captivate millions of readers decades later. The Tattooist of Auschwitz, the novel by Heather Morris, was published in 2018 and quickly became a worldwide phenomenon. It was based on the testimony of Lali, who tattooed prisoner numbers on hundreds of thousands of inmates who were sent to Auschwitz in Nazi-occupied Poland. A new Sky adaptation (top right) of Morris's novel is being released this week. The six-part series stars both Jonah Hauer-King and Harvey Keitel as Lali, whilst Polish actress Anna Próchniak portrays Gita. Both Lali and Gita survived the Holocaust and went on to marry in October 1945. Lali kept his story to himself for decades before revealing all to Morris.

                Barbra Streisand left fans reeling after publicly grilling Melissa McCarthy about Ozempic use in a barbed Instagram comment on Monday before she quickly backtracked and deleted the remark.. McCarthy, 53, caught Streisand's eye when she posted an image of herself and pal Adam Shankman, 59, in Los Angeles on Sunday at CTG's The Gala 2024 at the Ahmanson Theatre. The comedian - whose weight has fluctuated over the years - showcased her newly slimmed down figure in a stylish mint dress and blazer.

                Arguably the Three Lions' best two players (pictured), fans will spend the last few weeks of the season hoping neither get injured as they chase success at club level with two of Europe's giants. Neither player will be giving Germany a second thought, however. Yet. While their respective league titles are decided - Kane's Bayern Munich have lost the title to Bayer Leverkusen while Bellingham's Real Madrid are 11 points clear at the top of La Liga - there is the small matter of the Champions League to decide.

       This is the moment a TikToker accidentally captured a 'serial thief' using a distraction technique to swipe her phone from under her nose - a trick which many others claim to have fallen victim to. Aminah Ali (pictured), 25, was filming a video a friend outside a restaurant in London earlier this month, when a woman arrived 'out of nowhere'. The content creator claims the lady asked for money, but as she did so was waving a piece of paper, which she sneakily allowed to drop over Aminah's device so she could take it. Aminah only realised her phone was missing a few minutes later and her 'heart dropped' when her friend Iryna Leterova revealed she had captured the moment the alleged thief positioned the paper so she could swipe the device.

        Plato, who died at the age of 80 or 81 in around 348BC, also welcomed a guest in his last hours. The passages have been illegible since their discovery in Herculaneum in 1750.

       In footage obtained by MailOnline, the hulking 6ft2, 20-stone man-mountain is seen being surrounded by nine officers. The bare-chested 31-year-old swipes out at one with his T-shirt in his hand and then walks menacingly towards him. He is stopped by another officer who pulls him back to the bar while a colleague takes aim with a taser, which seemingly has no effect. Vunipola glares over at the policeman who still has the taser trained on him but starts laughing out loud. As he tries to put his shirt back on, he is hit by second dart, which this time incapacitates him and sends him stumbling forward. The officers then pounce on him on mass and bundle him onto the floor, where they cuff his hands

       Jamie Vardy and his Leicester City team-mates are still singing, dancing, and carousing after sealing the Championship title. Leicester beat Preston 3-0 at Deepdale on Monday night to bring silverware back up to the Premier League, with Vardy bagging two goals. Their changing rooms celebrations were boisterous and mocked Leeds United as the players all bounced and belted out Kaiser Chiefs' rock ditty 'I Predict a Riot'. Vardy and his pals took that song back to one of their houses on Tuesday morning and made merry with beer, games, and dancing, sharing their joy on Instagram.

                Royal watchers have accused Queen Mary and King Frederik of Denmark of photoshopping their first official royal portrait weeks after their British counterparts were slammed for putting out 'fake' Mother's Day pictures (right). Eagle-eyed fans claimed that: 1. The image of Queen Mary was a separate portrait. 2. Her hand placement over King Frederik's proved this. 3. Frederik looked like he'd 'rolled out of bed', while his wife looked regal. Meanwhile, Kate's Mother's Day portrait of her family was pulled by pictured agenceis after 16 editing fails were revealed.

                The life coach and author, 30, who often appears on ITV to give advice about relationships, shocked fans revealing that the couple's engagement had ended after just 24 hours. Now MailOnline can reveal how she paid tribute to her ex Ben just months before they ended their almost three-year relationship. In her latest book The Selfish Romantic, that was published in January, she wrote a gushing tribute to her boyfriend, telling her fans their 'love story will always be [her] favourite'.

                ISAAN KHAN: Being the partner of a footballer can spring up certain assumptions. Salacious gossip, a hunger for the public eye and extravagant opulence are some. Yet, when a video of Martin Odegaard's girlfriend Helene Spilling celebrating Arsenal's 5-0 thumping of Chelsea to Shakira's 'Waka Waka' in the Emirates stands last week went viral on social media, it was a microcosm of a culture created by Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. A culture that has brought the families of his players on board his team's ambitions.

                Angela Hutchinson, from Central Coast, New South Wales, Australia, struggled with her double chin since she was a teenager (pictured left, before surgery). The 33-year-old lost 1st 8lbs to drop to 12st 2lb but was 'disheartened' to find her chin hadn't budged. Angela decided to go for chin liposuction - where fat is removed from the chin via a cannula - after spotting a TikTok influncer talking about her experience. The mother-of-four travelled two hours to get it done in Sydney and spent £2,085  on the procedure (pictured centre and right, after surgery).

                The Duchess of Edinburgh's visit to Ukraine (right) has 'proved she's the Royal Family's champion of women's rights' while Meghan Markle (inset) 'wasted her potential' by sending jam to celebrities, a royal expert has claimed. Prince Edward's wife, 59, bravely denounced Putin's forces for using rape as weapon of war as she became the first British royal to visit Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Sussex, 42, is gearing up to launch her lifestyle brand American Riviera Orchard and has most recently sent pilates instructor Heather Dorak a sample of her 'kid-tested, mother-approved' preserve. Speaking to FEMAIL, royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams noted how Meghan's work around women's rights appears to have waned in the wake of Megxit. He explained: 'We know that Meghan is a feminist who promotes women's rights. At the age of 11 she famously protested against a sexist commercial. This potential has surely been wasted since she and Harry stepped down from royal duties.' In contrast, the expert noted how the Duchess of Edinburgh has been tirelessly working in the women's rights realm over the past few years alongside her sister-in-law Queen Camilla. Left: Sophie visiting a women's centre in Sierra Leone in 2020. Centre left: Sophie before giving a women's rights speech at the UN in New York. Centre right: eanne Mukunilwa, a survivor of conflict-related sexual violence in October 2022.

       A group of Spring Breakers on a giant yacht riding off the South Florida coast showed no regard for their environment as they were caught on video dumping trash into the Atlantic Ocean. Florida 's annual Boca Bash was in full swing over the weekend as 10,000 revelers took to the high seas for a wild party as liquor flowed and clothes were minimal on the waters off Florida's coast. Videos of the dumping have been viewed by hundreds of thousands of people across the world on various social media platforms, but the most angry are the locals who are going to be dealing with the after-effects long after they're gone.

                My legs gave way and I fell down the stairs. As I was lying on my back in a heap, I was struck by how ironic this was: I was a neuro-rehabilitation physiotherapist, and it would normally be me teaching people how to go up and down stairs safely. Yet here I was, helpless on the floor.' Elisabeth Briggs, 48, a mother of three teenagers, from Newport, Shropshire, fights back tears as she recounts how her life changed after she contracted Covid at the start of the pandemic - which then developed into long Covid and led to her dangerous fall. 'Before the pandemic, I was a busy mum, with lots of plates spinning,' she says.

       Rishi Sunak showed he is getting pumped for the general election as he joined Home Secretary James Cleverly in a charity press-up challenge this morning. The PM and his top Cabinet minister met up in the Downing Street garden as Mr Cleverly completed the last day of a Cancer Research UK campaign. The charity have been encouraging Britons to complete 100 push-ups a day throughout April to help fund breakthroughs in cancer treatments. In a video on Mr Cleverly's Instagram page, the PM was shown joining the Home Secretary for the last day of the challenge after arriving back from his morning run. After greeting his boss, Mr Cleverly was shown complimenting Mr Sunak on his 'good form' as they completed 20 press-ups. But their task was made no easier by the PM's dog Nova jumping all over them on the Downing Street lawn. 'No, no, no thank you,' Mr Sunak shouted as his labrador retriever disrupted them, adding: 'Oh my God. No, Nova!'

                Disturbing footage has captured the sickening moment two bears were forced to box one another on their hind legs in front of a laughing audience at a cruel Russian circus. The wild beasts - removed from their natural habitats - can be seen dressed in shorts and wearing boxing gloves in shocking videos shared online. The animals are made to perform in boxing rings under fluorescent lights in front of large and loud audiences in resorts like Sochi on the Black Sea. Horror video captured by an audience member at one bout act showed two bears fighting each other - each with a circus trainer gripping onto a rope attached to the large predators in an effort to keep them under control. Bright spotlights glare down onto the brown bears who are then forced into the centre of the ring, before they begin pushing and shoving one another.

                Francis Ngannou has perhaps overcome adversity to triumph against all the odds life stacked against him more than any other fighting champion in history.  It is one of the reasons the softly-spoken, hard-punching powerhouse is adored by fans and there has been such an outpouring of sympathy at the heartbreaking news that his 15-month old son, Kobe, has died.  Posting on Instagram, Ngannou, 37, said: 'Too soon to leave but yet he's gone. My little boy, my mate, my partner Kobe was full of life and joy. Now, he's laying without life. I shouted his name over and over but he's not responding.

        Want to know just how valuable it is having your own GP who knows you, and who you see at every appointment? Yesterday the Mail reported that nearly a third of patients 'rarely' saw the same one.

       This is the hilarious moment a gardener covers himself in soil after his wheelbarrow tipped over. Paul Francis, 56, was walking up a ramp to unload his wheelbarrow after doing some work in the garden - when he lost his footing and fell forward. The wheelbarrow tipped backwards and poured soil all over his head. Paul's wife, Nelsi Villalon Aguilera, 44, was in the kitchen at the time but came back to find Paul cleaning up.

                The Treetops - an elaborate three-bedroom shack on a tree at the edge of a watering hole in Aberdar National Park - was where the monarch famously 'went up the tree a Princess and came down a Queen' after King George VI died on February 6, 1952. Prince Philip told Elizabeth - who didn't know she had become the Queen - about the death of her father later in their tour of Kenya when they were staying in the nearby Sagana Lodge. The Mau Mau rebellion, which started in the same year as Elizabeth's fateful visit, saw the tree house being used as a British snipers' nest before it was burnt down by the rebels, who had a stronghold in a nearby forest, in 1954. It was rebuilt into a 36-room hotel on stilts that included a Princess Elizabeth suite and had royal memorabilia on its walls.

                Being a part of the Royal Family comes with a plethora of rules and traditions that extend even to clothing and styling choices. Royal women should, for example, refrain from removing coats in public since it is viewed as an unladylike. Nail varnish should be neutral, not coloured. And then it comes to feet: it is judged inappropriate to wear open toe shoes for an official engagement! Going bare foot is out of the question.

       Jesse Rossi and his daughter got terrifyingly close to the powerful EF3 tornado near Marietta, in southern Oklahoma, on Saturday. Their car was almost hit by debris during a Facebook Live stream by Jesse as the pair drove on the highway. Jesse and his daughter are heard discussing the cloud formation ahead of them as they see lightening and realize they are directly facing the tornado. As they decide to pull over. a large piece of metal falls right in front of their car, sparking panic in the storm chasers. At least 25 tornadoes killed four people in the state and left thousands without power Sunday, with at least 100 people injured. Footage of the aftermath in Marietta shows a Dollar Tree distribution center completely destroyed and ripped open by the twister. More than 20,000 people were still without electricity hours after tornadoes began late Saturday night. The destruction was extensive in Sulphur, a town of about 5,000 people, where a tornado crumpled many downtown buildings, tossed cars and buses and sheared the roofs off houses across a 15-block radius.

       The two-year-old bear, named Juniper, devoured the ducks while several children cried and smacked the glass to distract her at the Woodland Park Zoo. The video begins with Juniper patiently watching the mother duck and her five baby ducklings by the pond. She then plunged into her bear pond, going straight for the ducks, grabbing and biting the fluffy ducklings one after another. Rachelle, a TikTok user who shared the video last week, mentioned it happened during her daughter's birthday party on April 23.

       The remnants of Pantabangan town, located in the middle of a reservoir in the eponymous dam in the province of Nueva Ecija, can now be explored once again and have proved a major tourist attraction, despite the punishing temperatures. Parts of a church, municipal hall marker and a collection of tombstones first resurfaced in March after several months of 'almost no rain', said Marlon Paladin, a supervising engineer for the National Irrigation Administration. It is the sixth time the nearly 300-year-old settlement has resurfaced since the reservoir was created to provide irrigation water for local farmers and generate hydro-power. But Paladin said this is the longest period of time the ruins have breached the water's surface, such is the severity of the drought. The reservoir's water level has fallen nearly 164 feet (50 metres) from its normal high level of 725 feet (221 metres), figures from the state weather forecaster show.

                Frontman Mick Jagger, who turns 81, looked like he had energy to burn on stage at the NRG stadium in Houston last night, as the Stones embark on a 16-date North American tour - and fellow bandmembers Keith Richards and Ronnie looked equally sprightly. The rockers have all overhauled their once hedonistic lifestyles in recent years - with gruelling workouts, healthy diets and life-saving surgery keeping them at the top of their game. (Pictured from left: Keith Richards, Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood (top row) in their younger years, and, bottom row, in Houston on Monday night)

                A Spanish model and influencer has claimed her father - a former LaLiga boss - banned her from from dating footballers - and now keeps them as friends instead. The 24-year-old has grown up around football for much of her life after her dad enjoyed a 17-year playing career in Spain - and picked up 21 caps for his country - before going on to manage 12 clubs. She has become a major public figure in Spain and has a huge profile on social media, with 350,000 people following her Instagram page - and a further 295,000 on TikTok.

                A divorce has historically been a sad or solitary ordeal, but that is all changing as experts have revealed that more and more Brits are throwing wild divorce parties to celebrate the end of their marriages. From divorce cakes, to divorce rings the drive to symbolise your separation, which 42 per cent of all UK marriages end in, has been rising for a quite a few years. Model Emily Ratajkowski broken the internet this week when she revealed she had her engagement ring split into two diamonds to make divorce rings following her separation from Sebastian Bear-McClard in 2022. Welbeck Manor Hotel in Plymouth, who publicly advertise divorce parties as part of their packages online, said: 'Divorce parties have become increasingly popular in recent years, and although some believe they are in bad taste, they can be cathartic for people who escaped abusive or destructive relationships.'

                Jenna Phipps, a content creator from Canada, revealed in January that se'd bought a rundown midcentury modern gem, with ambitious plans to fix it up. The pitiable state of the house, however, could not be overstated, with extensive water damage that had created holes in the ceiling and floors, and was gradually causing the roof to collapse. On top of that, it was rife with mold as well as infested with mice and insects.
