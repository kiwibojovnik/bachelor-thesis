<P>After years of effort, we are delighted to
release <a href="https://nmap.org/book/">Nmap Network Scanning: The
Official Nmap Project Guide to Network Discovery and Security
Scanning</a>!

<p>From explaining port scanning basics for novices to
detailing low-level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers,
this book by Nmap's original author suits all levels of security and
networking professionals. The reference guide documents every Nmap
feature and option, while the remainder demonstrates how to apply them
to quickly solve real-world tasks. Examples and diagrams show actual
communication on the wire. Topics include subverting firewalls and
intrusion detection systems, optimizing Nmap performance, and
automating common networking tasks with the Nmap Scripting Engine.

<h2 class="purpleheader">Nmap 4.85BETA7 Released to Scan for Conficker Worm</h2>

<P>The Conficker worm is receiving a lot of attention because of its
vast scale (millions of machines infected) and advanced update
mechanisms.  Conficker isn't the end of the Internet (despite some of
that hype), but it <b>is</b> a huge nuisance we can all help to clean
up.

<P>Thanks to excellent <a href="http://www.honeynet.org/papers/conficker/">research</a> by Tillmann Werner and Felix Leder
of <a href="http://www.honeynet.org/">The Honeynet Project</a> and
implementation work by Ron Bowes, David Fifield, Brandon Enright, and
Fyodor, we've rolled out a new Nmap release which can remotely scan
for and detect infected machines.  Nmap 4.85BETA7 is now available
from the <a href="https://nmap.org/download.html">download page</a>,
including official binaries for Windows and Mac OS X.  To scan for
Conficker, use a command such as:
<br><b>nmap -PN -T4 -p139,445 -n -v --script smb-check-vulns,smb-os-discovery --script-args safe=1 [targetnetworks]</b><br>

<P>You will only see Conficker-related output if either port 139 or 445 are open on a host.  A clean machine reports at the bottom: &ldquo;<b>Conficker: Likely CLEAN</b>&rdquo;, while likely infected machines say: &ldquo;<b>Conficker: Likely INFECTED</b>&rdquo;.  For more advice, see <a href="https://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q1/0869.html">this nmap-dev post by Brandon Enright</a>.

<P>While Conficker gets all the attention, 4.85BETA7 also has <a href="https://nmap.org/changelog.html">many other great improvements</a>.

<P><b>Update:</b> Changed version from 4.85BETA5 (first to detect Conficker) to 4.85BETA7, which includes <a href="https://nmap.org/changelog.html">further Conficker detection improvements, among other changes</a>.

<h2 class="purpleheader">Nmap 4.75 Released</h2>

<P>We are pleased to <a href="https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2008/0004.html">release</a> Nmap 4.75, with <a href="https://nmap.org/changelog.html">almost 100 significant improvements</a> since version 4.68. Key Nmap 4.75 changes include:
<UL>

<LI>Fyodor spent much of this summer scanning tens of millions of IPs
  on the Internet (plus collecting data contributed by some
  enterprises) to determine the most commonly open ports. Nmap now
  uses that empirical data to scan more effectively.

<LI>Zenmap Topology and Aggregation features were added, as discussed in the next news item.

<LI>Hundreds of OS detection signatures were added, bringing the total to 1,503.

<LI>Seven new Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) scripts were added.  These
automate routing AS number lookups, &ldquo;Kaminsky&rdquo; DNS bug
vulnerability checking, brute force POP3 authentication cracking, SNMP
querying and brute forcing, and whois lookups against target IP space.
Many valuable libraries were added as well.

<LI>Many performance improvements and bug fixes were implemented.  In
particular, Nmap now works again on Windows 2000.

</UL>

<P>Many of these changes were discussed in Fyodor's Black Hat and Defcon presentations.  The audio and video has now been <a href="/presentations/">posted on the presentations page</a>.

<P>Download the source tarball or binaries for Linux, Windows, or Mac OS X from the <a href="https://nmap.org/download.html">Nmap download page</a>.  If you find any bugs, please <a href="https://nmap.org/book/man-bugs.html">report them</a>.

<h2 class="purpleheader">Zenmap Gains Topology Maps and Aggregation Features</h2>

<P><a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-topology.html"><img src="https://nmap.org/book/images/zenmap-fig-topology-fill-255x143.png" align=right width=255 height=143></a>

<P>While Nmap stands for &ldquo;Network Mapper&rdquo;, it hasn't been
able to actually draw you a map of the network&mdash;until now!  The
new <a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-topology.html">Zenmap Network
Topology feature</a> provides an interactive, animated visualization
of the hosts on a network and connections between them.  The scan
source is (initially) in the center, with other hosts on a series of
concentric circles which represent the number of hops away they are
from the souce.  Nodes are connected by lines representing discovered paths between them.  Read the full details (and oogle the pretty pictures)
in our article
on <a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-topology.html">Surfing the
Network Topology</a>.  Special thanks go to Jo&atilde;o Medeiros,
David Fifield, and Vladimir Mitrovic for their tireless work in
developing and integrating this new feature.

<P>Another exciting new Zenmap feature
is <a href="https://nmap.org/book/zenmap-scanning.html#aggregation">scan
aggregation</a>, which allows you to combine the results of many Nmap
scans into one view. When one scan is finished, you may start another
in the same window.  Results of the new scan are seamlessly merged
into one view.

<P>You can try these and many other great features with the latest version of <a href="https://nmap.org/zenmap">Zenmap</a>, available from the <a href="https://nmap.org/download.html">Nmap download page</a>.

<h2 class="purpleheader">Nmap Summer News Roundup</h2>

<UL>
<LI>Fyodor spoke in Las Vegas at the Black Hat Briefings and Defcon to discuss the results of large-scale Internet
scans he has been conducting, and demonstrate how you can use the
empirical data to make your scans (over the Internet or even internal)
more efficient. He also showed off some new
Nmap features which can help you bypass firewall restrictions, reduce
scan times, and gather more information about remote hosts.  The presentation video is now <a href="https://nmap.org/presentations/">available on the presentations page</a>.

<LI>RSS feeds for mailing lists archived by <a href="https://seclists.org">SecLists.Org</a> now sport message excerpts to make it easier to identify interesting messages.

<h2 class="purpleheader">Nmap Celebrates 10th Anniversary With Major Version 4.50 Release</h2>

<P>After nearly two years of work since the <a href="https://insecure.org/stf/Nmap-4.00-Release.html">4.00 release</a>, Insecure.Org is pleased to <a
href="stf/Nmap-4.50-Release.html">announce</A> the immediate, free
availability of the Nmap Security Scanner version 4.50 from <a
href="https://nmap.org">https://nmap.org</a> .  Nmap was first released in 1997, so this release celebrates our 10th anniversary!

<P>Major new features since 4.00 include
the <a href="https://nmap.org/zenmap/">Zenmap cross-platform
GUI</a>, <a href="https://nmap.org/book/osdetect.html">2nd Generation
OS Detection</a>, the <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse.html">Nmap Scripting Engine</a>, a rewritten host discovery system, performance
optimization, advanced traceroute functionality,  TCP and IP options support, and nearly 1,500 new <a href="https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html">version detection</a> signatures.  Dozens of
other important changes&mdash;and future plans for Nmap&mdash;are listed in the <a
href="stf/Nmap-4.50-Release.html">release announcement</a>.  We recommend that all current Nmap users <a href="https://nmap.org/download.html">upgrade</a>.

<p><b>Update</b>: Joe Barr at Linux.Com has written a <a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/125894">great review</a> of Nmap 4.50.  In addition to testing the new features, he offers substantial background information on port scanning.

<h2 class="purpleheader">Nmap Featured in The Bourne Ultimatum</h2>

<P>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VWYJ86?tag=secbks-20">The Bourne Ultimatum</a> (<a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0440963/">IMDB</a>), the CIA needs to hack the mail server of a newspaper (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian UK</a>) to read the email of a reporter they assassinated.  So they turn to <a href="https://nmap.org">Nmap</a> and its new official GUI <a href="https://nmap.org/zenmap/">Zenmap</a> to hack the mail server!  Nmap reports that the mail server is running SSH 3.9p1, Posfix smtpd, and a name server (presumably bind).  They also make substantial use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash">Bash, the Bourne-again shell</a>.  Congratulations to Roger Chui for being the first to spot this.  He also sent a <a href="https://nmap.org/misc/bourne-transcript.html">scene transcript</a> and the following HD screen shots (click for full resolution):

<p>Other movies which have used Nmap include:
<a href="https://nmap.org/movies.html#matrix">Matrix Reloaded</a>,
<a href="https://nmap.org/movies.html#bourne">Bourne Ultimatum</a>,
<a href="https://nmap.org/movies.html#13game">13: Game of Death</a>,

<a href="https://nmap.org/movies.html#listening">The Listening</a>, and, uhh,
<a href="https://nmap.org/movies.html#haxxxor">HaXXXor: No Longer Floppy</a>.  Screens shots of Nmap in all of these movies are available on <a href="https://nmap.org/movies.html">our new Nmap movies page</a>.  Nmap has become quite the movie star!

<h2 class="purpleheader">Introducing Zenmap, the Official Nmap GUI</h2>

<P><a href="https://nmap.org/zenmap/"><img src="https://nmap.org/zenmap/images/zenmap-multi-thumb-392x225.png" border=0 align=right width=392 height=225></a>
<P>After more than two years of development (starting with a 2005 Google Summer of Code project), we have replaced the venerable but dated NmapFE with a new cross-platform GUI named <a href="https://nmap.org/zenmap/">Zenmap</a>.  It is cross platform (tested on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X) and supports all Nmap options.  Its results viewer allows easier browsing, searching, sorting, and saving of Nmap results.

<p>Zenmap will appear in the upcoming 4.50 release and is already available in the release candidate packages on the <a href="https://nmap.org/download.html">Nmap download page</a>.  Zenmap screenshots and documentation are available at <a href="https://nmap.org/zenmap/">https://nmap.org/zenmap</a>.

<p>Zenmap is still under active development, but was integrated early because it is already much more powerful than NmapFE.  Development is coordinated on the <a href="https://seclists.org/#nmap-dev">nmap-dev mailing list</a>.

<h2 class="purpleheader">Nmap Featured in Die Hard 4</h2>

<P>Yippee Ki-Yay! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VNMMR0?tag=secbks-20">In Die Hard 4: Live Free or Die Hard</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_hard_4">Wikipedia</a>,
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/">IMDB</a>), Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) is dispatched to retrieve hacker Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) because the FBI suspects him of breaching their computer systems.  Later, Justin is enlisted to help thwart terrorist mastermind Thomas Gabrial's attempts at total World destruction. In this Scene, Farrell demonstrates his Nmap skills:

that the Nmap man page has been completely rewritten.  It is more
comprehensive (double the length) and much better organized than the
previous one.  It is meant to serve as a quick-reference to virtually
all Nmap command-line arguments, but you can learn even more about
Nmap by reading it straight through. The 18 sections include <a
href="https://nmap.org/book/man-briefoptions.html">Brief

that are slated for release in the next Nmap version (<a

<h2 class="purpleheader">Nmap Gains Advanced Version Detection</h2>

<P>After several months of intense private development, we are pleased to <A HREF="https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2003/Jul-Sep/0005.html">release Nmap 3.45</A>, including an advanced <A HREF="https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html">version detection system</A>.  Now instead
of using a simple nmap-services table lookup to determine a port's
likely purpose, Nmap will (if asked) interrogate that TCP or UDP
port to determine what service is really listening. In many cases it
can determine the application name and version number as well.
Obstacles like SSL encryption and Sun RPC are no threat, as Nmap can
connect using OpenSSL (if available) as well as utilizing Nmap's RPC
bruteforcer. IPv6 is also supported.  You can read our new <A
HREF="https://nmap.org/book/vscan.html">version detection paper</A> for the
details and examples, or just download the latest version and try it
out <A HREF="nmap/">here</A>.  Simply add "-sV" to your normal scan
command-line options.

ridiculous 3D animated eye-candy scenes as hacking.  So I <A
HREF="https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2003/Apr-Jun/0010.html">was
shocked</A> to find that Trinity does it properly in <A HREF="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0234215">The Matrix Reloaded</A> [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000AXE8I?tag=secbks-20">Under $6 at Amazon</a>].
