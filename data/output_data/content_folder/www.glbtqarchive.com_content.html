		<p style="font-size:11pt">The Literature section of the glbtq Encyclopedia was originally based on a printed book, <i>The Gay and Lesbian Literary Heritage</i> (New York: Henry Holt, 1995; rev. ed. New York and London: Routledge, 2002) edited by 	Claude Summers. The entries based on the contents of that book are unavailable in this archive as the license to reproduce its contents has expired.

		<p>About the glbtq Project</p>

<blockquote style="font-size:11pt">
<p>The glbtq project was founded in 2000 by Publisher Wik Wikholm to create the world's largest encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer culture and history and to deliver it online. The contents of the encyclopedia were formed and overseen by General Editor Claude Summers, Copy Editor Ted-Larry Pebworth, and Assistant to the Editor Linda Rapp. After more than two years of work, the site launched in 2003.</p>

<p>The site grew to become the largest glbtq encyclopedia ever created thanks to the work of its editors and more than 350 contributors. The website also included a variety of essays, a few interviews with contemporary figures,  and, during its last few years of operation, a blog written by Claude Summers. Claude Summers' blog is archived at the ONE Institute in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The project also produced three books: <i>The Queer Encyclopedia of the Visual Arts</i> (2004); <i>The Queer Encyclopedia of Music, Dance, and Musical Theater</i> (2004); and <i>The Queer Encyclopedia of Film and Television</i> (2005), all published by Cleis Press.</p>

<p>The website closed on August 1, 2015 because of the collapse of the online advertising business model that had supported it.</p>
