<h3> April 21. 2019</h3>

<p>Help guide future development of CGIProxy by taking <a href="survey.html">the new CGIProxy user survey</a>!
If you have ever used CGIProxy, or have installed it on a server (or tried to install it), please
tell us how your experience has been.  All questions are optional, but every answer you give us
is helpful.  We won't keep any personal information, but you can enter your email address if you
want a response.  Your responses will help us know how to best improve CGIProxy for all users,
how to make the installation easier, etc.  If you know anyone else that uses CGIProxy, please tell
them about the survey too.  Thank you so much for your help!


<h3>January 26, 2019</h3>

<p>Released CGIProxy 2.2.4 .  Major improvements include:
<ul>
    <li>The top form is now in its own HTML page with an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> containing
	the fetched page, rather than being inserted into the page's HTML, and
	it behaves <i>much</i> better than before.  Please tell me of any remaining
	display bugs you find.
    <li>The starting page is a little more user-friendly, with language names and
	better button placement.
    <li>Fixed various bugs, making most websites work again.
</ul>

<p>Note that as of version 2.2.3, the <a href="install.html">installation</a>
and <a href="install.html#upgrade">upgrade</a> processes are much
easier than they used to be, especially for non-technical users.  <b>Please
<a href="mailto:james@jmarshall.com?subject=CGIProxy+installation">tell me</a>
about any problems you have, so I can fix them!</b>  The more I hear about any
problems, the better these features will work in future releases.
Also, please tell me if anything is confusing or unclear about the installation.

<p>Here's a more <a href="CHANGES.txt">complete list of changes</a>, including
previous versions.

<p>A list of past announcements is on the <a href="news.html">news page</a>.

<p>For your own safety, please read about <a href="security.html">security with CGIProxy</a>.

<p><b><i>Note that I welcome all bug reports and fix those bugs when I have time,
so please use the "Report a bug" link in the top form when you see errors.  This is
especially true of bugs when using any new features.</i></b>

<h2>What it is, what it is</h2>

This CGI script (or other) acts as an HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP proxy.  Through it, you can
retrieve any resource that is accessible from the server it runs on.
This is useful when your own access is limited, but you can reach a
server that in turn can reach others that you can't.  In addition,
the user is kept as anonymous as possible from any servers.  Common
uses include:  anonymous proxies, other personal uses, VPN-like functionality,
and others.  It's very simple to install, and very configurable.

<p>When an HTML resource is retrieved, it's modified so that all links in it
point back through the same proxy, including images, form submissions, and
everything else.  JavaScript and Flash apps are similarly "proxified".
Once you're using the proxy, you can browse normally and (almost) forget it's there.

<p>CGIProxy can run in four ways: as a CGI script, as a
<a href="http://perl.apache.org">mod_perl</a> script, as a
<a href="http://www.fastcgi.com">FastCGI script</a>, or with its own embedded
secure HTTP server.  Configurable options include text-only support (to save bandwidth),
selective cookie and script removal, simple ad filtering, access restriction
by server, custom encoding of target URLs and cookies, and more-- there are
more than <a href="options.html">70 options</a> so far.  It requires
<a href="http://www.perl.com">Perl 5.6.1</a> or later, but works better with
a more recent version.

<p>Of course, you must read the <a href="#legal">Legal Disclaimer</a>
before using this software.

<p>Here's 
<a href="http://www.prismnet.com/~jsm/cgiproxy/nph-demo.cgi">a demo</a>
(username "<b>free</b>", password "<b>speech</b>"), that lets you
browse in the domains
<a href="http://www.prismnet.com/~jsm/cgiproxy/nph-demo.cgi/en/20/http/jmarshall.com/">jmarshall.com</a>,

<p>The original seed for this was a program I wrote for Rich Morin's
<a href="http://cfcl.com/rdm/Pubs/tin/P/199606.shtml">article</a>
in the June 1996 issue of Unix Review.

<p>Here are <a href="releases/">older versions</a>, but don't use them
anymore.


<p><hr>
<a name="usage"></a>
<h2>To Use</h2>

<p>After installing CGIProxy on a server, visit the script's URL to start a
browsing session.  Once you've gotten a page through the proxy, everything
it links to will automatically go through the proxy.  You can bookmark pages
you browse to, and your bookmarks will go through the proxy as they did the
first time.


<p><hr>
<a name="limits"></a>
<h2>Limits and Bugs</h2>

<ul>

<p><li>Anonymity <b>MAY NOT BE PERFECT!!</b> In particular, there may be some
    holes where unproxified JavaScript or Flash content can slip through.
    (If you find these or any other anonymity holes, please tell me!)  For
    best anonymity, turn JavaScript and Flash off in your browser.
<p><li>I didn't follow the spec on HTTP proxies, and there are violations
    of the protocol.  Actually, this whole concept is a violation of the
    proxy model, so I'm not too worried.  If any protocol violations cause
    you problems, please let me know.
<p><li>Only HTTP/HTTPS and FTP are supported so far.
</ul>


<p><hr>
<a name="legal"></a>
<h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Censorship is a controversial subject, and some governments and
companies have rules about what information you should have access to.
If you use my software to bypass rules that have been imposed on you,
you assume all legal risks and responsibilities involved.  I'm
providing the software as a demonstration and teaching tool, and for
when legitimate access is needed to non-accessible servers.  I won't
encourage you to break any rules, because I would get in trouble if I
did.  I can't prevent you from using this software in illegitimate ways,
but I believe the value of it as a teaching tool is far too great to let
a few miscreants ruin it for everybody.
