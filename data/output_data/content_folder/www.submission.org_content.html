			Submission or Islam in the Arabic language is a meaning or a description rather than a name or a title. It describes the state of mind of anyone who recognizes Godâs absolute authority, and reaches a conviction that God alone possesses all power; no other entity possesses any power or control independent of Him. The logical consequence of such a realization is to devote oneâs life and oneâs worship absolutely to God alone.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, Submission (or Islam in Arabic language) is a spiritual state of mind and not a title of a religion that belongs to a specific group of people. ANYONE who submits and worships one God without idolizing other entities is a Submitter by definition (Muslim in Arabic language). 
		</p>
		<p>
			This state of mind basically conforms with Godâs one and only message He delivered to man-kind through all of His messengers since Noah; worship God alone and avoid idolatry. Based on that, one can safely conclude that the message of Islam or Submission has been in existence way before the time of prophet Muhammad and way before Quran. All Godâs messengers, since Noah, devoted their lives and worship to God alone and were Submitters to Him alone.
		</p>
		<div class="quran" lang="en">
			<p>
				[Final Testament/Quran 21:25] We did not send any messenger before you except with the inspiration: "There is no god except Me; you shall worship Me alone."
			</p>
			<p>
				[Final Testament/Quran 16:36] We have sent a messenger to every community, saying, "You shall worship God, and avoid idolatry....."
			</p>
			<p>
				[Final Testament/Quran 10:71] Recite for them the history of Noah. He said to his people, "O my people, if you find my position and my reminding you of God's revelations too much for you, then I put my trust in God. You should get together with your leaders, agree on a final decision among yourselves, then let me know it without delay.<br/>
				[Final Testament/Quran 10:72] "If you turn away, then I have not asked you for any wage. My wage comes from God. I have been commanded to be a submitter."
			</p>
			<p>
				[Final Testament/Quran 2:133] Had you witnessed Jacob on his death bed; he said to his children, "What will you worship after I die?" They said, "We will worship your god; the god of your fathers Abraham, Ismail, and Isaac; the one god. To Him we are submitters."
			</p>
			<p>
				[Final Testament/Quran 3:52] When Jesus sensed their disbelief, he said, "Who are my supporters towards God?" The disciples said, "We are God's supporters; we believe in God, and bear witness that we are submitters."
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			With this understanding in mind, and how Submission to God alone has been the only message God delivered through all His messengers, we can easily conclude that it is indeed the only religion that has been delivered, authorized, and approved by God. This is stated clearly in God's Final Testament:
		</p>
		<div class="quran" lang="en">
			<p>
				[Final Testament/Quran 3:19] The only religion approved by God is "Submission." Ironically, those who have received the scripture are the ones who dispute this fact, despite the knowledge they have received, due to jealousy. For such rejectors of God's revelations, God is most strict in reckoning.
			</p>
			<p>
				[Final Testament/Quran 3:85] Anyone who accepts other than Submission as his religion, it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter, he will be with the losers.
			</p>
			<p>
				[Final Testament/Quran 21:92] Your congregation is but one congregation, and I alone am your Lord; you shall worship Me alone.
<br/>[Final Testament/Quran 21:93] However, they divided themselves into disputing religions. All of them will come back to us (for judgment).
<br/>[Final Testament/Quran 21:94] As for those who work righteousness, while believing, their work will not go to waste; we are recording it.

			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			By the will of God, this site is made available to shed the light on, define and promote Godâs message to mankind since Noah; Submission to Him alone. It is our mission to present the whole truth we know about the religion of Submission (Islam in Arabic language).
		</p>
		<p>
			Knowledge is the cure for one's ignorance.

			"And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."<br/>[Bible, John 8:32]
		</p>

		<p>
			[Final Testament/Quran 17:36] "You shall not accept any information, unless you verify it for yourself. I have given you the hearing, the eyesight, and the brain, and you are responsible for using them."

		[The Final Testament/Quran 2:62] Surely, those who believe, those who are Jewish, the Christians, and the converts; anyone who (1) believes in God, and (2) believes in the Last Day, and (3) leads a righteous life, will receive their recompense from their Lord. They have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 2:136] Say, "We believe in God, and in what was sent down to us, and in what was sent down to Abraham, Ismail, Isaac, Jacob, and the Patriarchs; and in what was given to Moses and Jesus, and all the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction among any of them. To Him alone we are submitters."
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 3:95] Say, "God has proclaimed the truth: You shall follow Abraham's religion - monotheism. He never was an idolater."
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 3:18] God bears witness that there is no god except He, and so do the angels and those who possess knowledge. Truthfully and equitably, He is the absolute god; there is no god but He, the Almighty, Most Wise.
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 6:114] Shall I seek other than God as a source of law, when He has revealed to you this book fully detailed? Those who received the scripture recognize that it has been revealed from your Lord, truthfully. You shall not harbor any doubt.
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 6:115] The word of your Lord is complete, in truth and justice. Nothing shall abrogate His words. He is the Hearer, the Omniscient.
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 6:116] If you obey the majority of people on earth, they will divert you from the path of God. They follow only conjecture; they only guess.
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 39:45] When God ALONE is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with aversion. But when others are mentioned beside Him, they become satisfied.
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 17:46] We place shields around their minds, to prevent them from understanding it, and deafness in their ears. And when you preach your Lord, using the Quran alone, they run away in aversion.
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 18:27] You shall recite what is revealed to you of your Lord's scripture. Nothing shall abrogate His words, and you shall not find any other source beside it.
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 45:6] These are God's revelations that we recite to you truthfully. In which Hadith other than God and His revelations do they believe?
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 6:161] Say, "My Lord has guided me in a straight path - the perfect religion of Abraham, monotheism. He never was an idol worshiper."
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 6:162] Say, "My Contact Prayers (Salat), my worship practices, my life and my death, are all devoted absolutely to God alone, the Lord of the universe.
	</div>
	<div>
		[The Final Testament/Quran 6:163] "He has no partner. This is what I am commanded to believe, and I am the first to submit."
