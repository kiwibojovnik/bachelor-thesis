<p>Welcome to the Orthodox Site for Inquirers and Converts! You have questions? We do or will have answers!</p>

<p>This site is focused towards helping those from a Western background to gain an understanding of the Orthodox view point. Inquirers and converts to Orthodoxy often have certain issues that they deal with either in seriously looking into the claims of Orthodoxy or particular issues that arise once committed to becoming Orthodox. Our goal here is not so much a "debate" or apologetics in the sense of trying to win an argument, but to show what and why we believe what we do in a manner that we hope will make sense to the Western mind. To that end, you will find Bible Studies as well as topical articles on various subjects.</p>

<p>For your information: Timothy Copple is the webmaster of this site. He is a reader in the Antiochian Archdiocese, and currently attends <a href="http://stjohngoldenco.org/" target="new">St. John Chrysostom Orthodox Church in Lakewood, CO</a>. However, this is not an official site of the Antiochian Archdiocese. While we do our best to reflect Orthodox theology and beliefs, as with anything on the Internet, double check what you find here with other sources like your local priest, as we are sinners and make mistakes.</p>

<p>Take some time to browse, or check the list of new additions below. Thanks for visiting!</p>
