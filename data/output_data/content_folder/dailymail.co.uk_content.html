        GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: Britain's towns and villages are being terrorised by sling-shot wielding children who are filming themselves abusing animals to post on social media. Residents say they are seeing 'more and more' anti-social behaviour recently and some believe it is due to a new social media trend. Locals in Kent believe the rise in catapult-related incidents are related to a trend of young people filming themselves firing ball bearings at animals and posting it online. Pensioners say they are too scared to go for walks alone, and animals ranging from cats to swans have been brutally injured. In Maidstone, a family was left devastated after their pet peacock was shot more than 20 times with slingshots and catapults and brutally killed. But this is only the latest in an alarming rise of catapult-related attacks by young people across the UK.

       Viewers were left concerned for the 10 o'clock news presenter as he suffered evident difficulties towards the end of the programme on Friday - and now a channel veteran has said there were warning signs beforehand. Nicholas Owen, a former ITV News presenter, sent a message of sympathy to Mr Omaar, 56, who has himself thanked the public for their support. The Mail On Sunday revealed that ITV news bosses did try to get Mr Omaar to hand over his bulletin to a stand-in anchor after he became unwell live on air. But there are new questions over whether more should have been done to protect him.

                Something about the woman on her television screen made Laura Wray feel uneasy. The lawyer, and widow of a Labour MP, was relaxing at home, captivated by the opening minutes of the Netflix sensation Baby Reindeer, particularly by the character Martha who stalks a struggling comedian. What was it about Martha that seemed so familiar? Maybe the raucous laugh that seemed to last just a bit too long, or the way she clutched her handbag to her side when timidly entering a pub. Whatever it was about this curly-haired Scot, she reminded Laura of someone from her past. The realisation came like an electric jolt, and Laura slumped back on her sofa, open-mouthed.

                The Desperate Housewives star, 49, and her husband, José Bastón, 56, are quitting Los Angeles for a life in Spain over fears their five-year-old son, Santiago (seen all together in the photo on left), will get 'sucked into the Hollywood cycle' if they don't escape the States, sources told DailyMail.com. The power couple recently slashed the price of their eight-bedroom Beverly Hills pad (photo inset) from $22.8 to $18.9 million - and have already started shipping their belongings to their newly renovated home in Marbella, Spain. 'Eva and José are leaving Los Angeles for good and have put their home up for sale again,' a source said. 'They took it off the market in June but recently relisted it for $4 million less in February because they are just ready to get out.'

       EXCLUSIVE: A civil war has erupted in a quiet leafy suburb overlooking Gatwick Airport after a sun-starved family hired a tree surgeon to cut back an enormous tree encroaching on their garden 'without' the permission of their neighbour. Sarah Davis, 40, told MailOnline that she was forced to take the drastic and expensive action as her 'insane' neighbour Sue Croft had repeatedly ignored requests to cut it back meaning their garden was being starved of natural light in the summer.

        Claire Nevinson, Boots superintendent pharmacist says your endless sniffles could be hay fever and not not a cold. Symptoms can overlap but it's helpful to know which one you've got.

                Prince Harry is set to return to Britain in just a few days for the Invictus Games 10th anniversary, but he will likely come solo as Meghan stays in Montecito. An Invictus Games spokesperson confirmed the Duke of Sussex will attend the Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday 8 May. Actor Damian Lewis is expected to recite the Invictus poem at St Paul's for the anniversary of the games for injured servicemen and women. A statement published on the Invictus Games' social media read: "The Invictus Games Foundation will celebrate 10 years of changing lives and saving lives with a 'Service of Thanksgiving' at St Paul's Cathedral on May 8th. 'We will be joined by our Patron, Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, actor Damian Lewis and members of the worldwide Invictus Community to mark the occasion."

                Penelope Cruz is turning 50-years-old on April 28 and she seems to be looking forward to it. 'Turning 50, it's a huge, beautiful thing, and I really want to celebrate that with all my friends,' she told Elle earlier this year. The star from Spain does not seem to age as she looks incredible youthful while approaching the big milestone. With her wrinkle-free face, thick and long black hair and tiny but toned frame, the siren has managed to keep herself very well preserved, making her look like she is in her late 30s and not almost 50. She has reason to stay young-looking: the Oscar winning actress not only acts on the big screen, but she also models for Chanel and Lancome. The wife of Javier Bardem , with whom she has two children, has addressed staying young looking saying she eats whole foods, uses wrinkles creams, takes Bioidentical hormones, works out four times a week and meditates.

        Who wouldn't secretly enjoy being the sexiest person in the room? Of course, most of us consider it impossible. We believe our age, face or figure rule us out. But happily, we're mistaken.

                Trafficking gangs have been revealed to be hiding migrants in abandoned Nazi bunkers before risking their lives on overcrowded dinghies crossing the Channel. Dozens of desperate Kurds are sheltering within concrete enclaves built by Adolf Hitler's forces during Germany 's Second World War occupation of France. The dune hideouts are less than a mile from the northern French coast between Calais and Dunkirk where migrants camp out ahead of attempts to reach the UK. The revelations come after would-be asylum seekers insisted they would not be deterred by Rishi Sunak 's 'stop the boats' plan finally passed by Parliament last week.

       Dublin is looking at legal avenues to force asylum seekers to return to Northern Ireland, after raising concerns that 80 per cent of recent arrivals had crossed the border. Taoiseach Simon Harris raised alarm that the 'integrity' of the Irish migration system is being affected, and wants to overturn a recent ruling that Britain cannot be classed as a 'safe' country to send people. His deputy, Micheál Martin, has pointed the finger at the Rwanda policy, saying that migrants were leaving the UK because they were 'fearful' of being sent to the African state. Talks with Home Secretary James Cleverly are expected to happen tomorrow in an effort to ease tensions. However, Rishi Sunak said the comments from Ireland showed that 'the deterrent is already having an impact'. Tories have shrugged off the suggestion that Dublin could try to return individuals who cross the border.

                There was understandable relief when Princess Beatrice 's year-long romance with American playboy Paolo Liuzzo finally broke apart in 2006. Beatrice was just 17, at the time. Liuzzo, a polo-playing socialite, was seven years her senior and devoted to the sort of hard-partying lifestyle guaranteed to cause significant embarrassment to the royals. At one point he'd been charged with manslaughter and possession of cocaine. Another time, he was convicted of affray. Even Beatrice's perpetually sunny mother, Sarah Ferguson, saw the downside of Paolo, noting of her eldest daughter that, 'We all have our own journeys and have to learn our way.' The princess was said to have been heartbroken when this, her first serious romance, collapsed. And some of that sorrow returned, say friends, when Beatrice learned of Liuzzo's sad death at the age of 41. The man she'd once loved had been found in Miami hotel room, killed by a suspected overdose of drugs.

                Just over a decade ago, a well-educated Russian historian was captured by authorities before they stumbled upon a grisly collection of hand-made human dolls in his apartment. Once a respected figure in his field, horrific truths began surfacing in 2011 about Anatoly Moskvin, 57, that revealed he was digging up dead females and turning them into dolls. It was believed he had desecrated around 150 graves in total. Scattered among the mounds of clutter within the home of Moskvin, from Nizhny Novgorod, Russia, were 26 mummified bodies of girls and women aged between three and 29. The scholar-turned-bodysnatcher had dug up the dead girls and lived with their corpses in his house of horrors after turning them into ghoulish playthings wearing lipstick and knee-length boots. He had dug up the bodies of the girls before taking them back to his home, where he would turn them into showpieces that resembled antique dolls with red lips, blushed cheeks, and brightly coloured dresses. Chilling images of his sickening collection show bodies and skeletons in stockings and costumes, and one was even dressed to resemble a child's teddy bear.

                As she studied an itemised drinks bill at one of London's most exclusive nightclubs, Charlotte Church was not happy, writes KATIE HIND. The receipt, the length one would expect from a family's weekly supermarket shop, was mostly made up of drinks that her boyfriend Kyle Johnson's friends had racked up, swigging vodka cocktails, which even back then - 20 years ago - cost at least £15 a pop. As she went through it, marking off with a biro pen what wasn't hers, the Welsh singer angrily declared: 'I'm going to make sure they pay.' Only they didn't. Some minutes later I watched, aghast, as Charlotte summoned the waiter in the VIP area of Cirque nightclub in London's Leicester Square and, her face like thunder, paid the lot on her credit card.

        A tourism agency has told workers they can't use words such as 'blindspot' or 'man hours' anymore as the language is not inclusive.

        Three soldiers and a cyclist were injured after the animals threw their riders and galloped off. The scenes were like a cross between that Lloyds Bank advert and a Quentin Tarantino movie.

                The porn industry has changed dramatically over the past three decades, with the rise of the internet and technology. Last century, one would walk into seedy shops and rent or purchase the X-rated films but with the rise of online sites like PornHub and OnlyFans, those days are long gone.  But what happened to the old school who were around in the 1990s and 2000s? One British porn actress, from London , quit her days of posing topless for Page 3 and starring in porn films and sat on the board of directors for West Ham, who are currently eighth in the premier league. Another, from Birmingham, spoke candidly about the toxic industry and went on to become a public speaker who is passionate about raising awareness of the exploitation of young girls. She also owns her own organic superfood company. But others dropped off the grid completely. A well-known adult actress who ranked 119th globally on PornHub's list was found living in the tunnels under Las Vegas in 2019. Femail takes a look at some of the most famous adult actors and actresses from around the world and what they're up to now.

                Nicole Kidman was supported by her daughters Sunday Rose, 15 (in floral dress), and Faith Margaret, 13 (next to her sister and cousin), as she received an AFI Lifetime Achievement Award. The 56-year-old movie star shares Sunday and Faith with her country star husband Keith Urban, who was also by Nicole's side for the glittering affair. Faith and Sunday glowed with filial pride as they stood beside their mother, who was decked out in a shimmering gold Balenciaga gown for the Los Angeles event.

                A Land Rover drove into a bike stand in central London and took a lamppost down along the way. Shocking images show the black 4x4 after it appeared to have collided with a lamppost and flattened it to the ground. The lamppost can be seen completely bent towards the path, with the Land Rover still sat on top. From the side of the Land Rover Defender, the lamppost head can be seen now facing upside down. One of the back tyres is deflated and black pieces are scattered on the ground nearby.

                Sitting at my laptop I watched a naked woman with my face having graphic penetrative sex in a variety of positions with a nude man. The pornographic video lasted for three minutes and 32 seconds, and grotesque as I found it, I made myself watch it all. I needed to understand exactly how realistic these images are, and also recognise how easy it was for people to access them online. Because as seamless as the footage appeared, it wasn't me at all - my face had been imposed on to another woman's body using artificial intelligence ( AI ) to make what is known as ' deepfake ' pornography.

        Ukraine now has powerful new American missiles which can travel almost 200 miles. Funnily enough, neither Washington nor Kiev were too keen to make this fact public.

                A family have been 'traumatised' after a vehicle hurdled through two fences into a back garden where their children were playing. The petrifying incident occurred in the Brians Well Grove area of Poleglass in West Belfast on Saturday morning. A grey Volkswagen swerved off a nearby roundabout before ploughing into the garden where a mother, her partner and children were having fun outside, the Belfast Telegraph reports. A 31-year-old has since been arrested under suspicion of driving while unfit through drink or drugs. Ex-Lord Mayor of Belfast Danny Baker said the family had a 'lucky escape' whilst posting the disturbing scene to social media.

                Dozens of men in Italy were seen presenting a fascist salute to honour Italian dictator Benito Mussolini on the 79th anniversary of his execution. Dressed in black, several neo-fascist supporters gathered in Dongo and in Giulino di Mezzegra to shout fascist chants during ceremonies on Sunday. The men marched through the northern Italian towns where Mussolini was arrested and executed at the end of World War II, and also in Predappio - the notorious dictator's birthplace and final resting place. The despot was stopped by anti-fascist partisans in Dongo, near Lake Como, on April 27, 1945, as he attempted to escape with his mistress, Clara Petacci, following the Allied liberation of Italy. On April 28, Mussolini and Petacci were executed and their bodies were taken to Meezzegra-Giulino to be hung in the city's central square - just two days before Hitler's suicide.

       This is the adorable moment a clever elephant returned a toddler's tiny shoe after it was dropped into a zoo enclosure. In the cute clip, the huge creature can be seen gently scooping up the tiny blue and yellow shoe using its enormous foot and lengthy trunk. Slowly grasping the minuscule footwear, the friendly giant delicately returned the shoe dropping it back into the young visitor's hand.

                A man who looks far younger than his actual age has revealed the secret behind his youthful appearance. Chuando Tan, a one-time pop star from Singapore, has an Instagram account that is filled with images that make him look barely a day past 25. Tan, who initially went viral back in 2017, after a Chinese website featured his Instagram profile, gained a slew of followers thanks to his ripped body which makes him look decades younger than he actually is.

                This Sunday, Arsenal will travel across the Seven Sisters Road to Tottenham and hash out one of the most bitter, heated rivalries in English football - the North London Derby.  It's the first game fans pick out when the fixtures are released, the most in-demand tickets on the market, and undoubtedly the most stressful days of any supporter's season.  The stakes are just that much higher; defeats are all the more painful, every blunder and mistake will be sent your way for the next six months by rival fans. But the victories are celebrated like a Cup Final and every scrap of joy eked out until the next meeting.

       The Nakizumo Crying Baby Festival is as bizarre as its name sounds - it celebrates the belief that babies crying will bring the youngsters good health and fortune in the future, as well as warding off any evil spirits or demons. The annual event is taking place this weekend (April 28) in Japan.

       At around 1.20pm on April 4, police tried to stop a black Cherokee Jeep near Kidlington, Oxfordshire. Adam Marmont, 27, refused to stop and sped through Yarnton, Bladon, Eynsham and Stanton Harcourt while driving at speeds of up to 80mph, doing dangerous overtakes and even driving the wrong way around roundabouts. Marmont continued to try and evade police even after his front nearside tyre was popped by officers using a stop stick. Eventually, his vehicle came to a stop when it collided with the rear of another vehicle on a single-track road near Northmoor and Marmont was arrested. He also broke his leg during the crash after ending up in a ditch.
