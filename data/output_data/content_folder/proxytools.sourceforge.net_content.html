        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p align="left">ProxyTools is a package of Perl network utilities 
designed  mainly to assist those  whose Internet access is censored, unreliable, 
or  otherwise damaged. Uncensored access is provided to any outside service
 required  (Usenet News, Web browsing, IRC, Socks etc.). Setup requires installation
  of Perl and some modules; this is doable by even a novice MS Windows user
  with email instruction, allowing help to be provided to those inside these
  countries from expert users outside.   </p>
        <p align="left">In pursuit of this rather non-specific goal, some 
interesting  network utilities have already been produced.  We think the code
is  interesting  in itself, useful in other areas, and would welcome contributions
to the  overall sum of ideas, concepts and ideals expressed in these tools.
 </p>
        <p align="left">The project is of interest to the following groups 
of people:   </p>
        <ul>
     	<li> those who live in Internet censoring countries (or corporations, 
 schools, universities)  such as the Middle East (United Arab Emirates, Kingdom 
 of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria),  China, Burma, etc. 	</li>
      <li> those who would wish to assist those in the group above. 	</li>
      <li> those who are interested in Perl code dealing with many aspects
 of  networks  at the socket level, and transactions using HTTP proxies.
One  tool  in this project  offers a 'failover' capability, and intelligent
choice,  between various censor-bypassing strategies and network paths, offering
the  user a robust, uncensored connection even in a  low bandwidth, unreliable,
 packet filtered and proxy-poor environment. 	</li>
      <li> those who administer the firewalls which do the censoring, and 
those  who might  be considering this. 	</li>
      <li> those who are just curious about the current techniques used by
 the   first group above. </li>
                           
        </ul>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p align="left">The project distribution contains the following tools: 
  </p>
        <h3>localProxy (<a href="lpScreenShot.jpg">screen shot</a>)</h3>
This is essentially a character switch, with some interest in the content
   switched. Normally run on the user's computer (but runnable on a Unix
ISP   shell outside the user's firewall) this application provides a user
with   localhost services to use which implement censor avoidance strategies
in   the background. A front end GUI &nbsp;is included which allows convenient
  control of the localProxy engine. A single 'AutoConfigure' button allows 
even a novice user  to map his local firewall rules and create a configuration
file which describes  his network environment, specifies proxy capabilities
which may be used to enable (by default) uncensored HTTP proxy and Usenet
News services; selection of this configuration will cause LP to build and
run the configuration. LocalProxy will build a running configuration based
 on a database of usable hosts and proxies, applying several sources of information
 relevant to accessible hosts, services, firewall rules and firewalled subnets.
 LocalProxy runs this configuration and makes connections for the user, learning
 to use  the fastest and most reliable of the censor-avoidance strategies
and  multiple proxy hosts/chains available. The application maintains (and
displays)  a 'useful data speed' for each level of the 'user'-&gt;'strategy'-&gt;'host'-&gt;'host'-&gt;website/service 
 chain, to assist the user with configuration.  The choices made by localProxy 
 in switching each request is based on  these speeds, ensuring localProxy 
avoids non-working strategies/hosts, and  ensuring maximum use of the available 
'uncensored bandwidth'.  Failover capabilities and robustness are built in, 
so that users need not frequently update the database of hosts whenever one
dies, becomes blocked, or is temporarily down.<br>
        <br>
LocalProxy (excluding Perl modules) is approximately 6000 lines of commented,
  debugged Perl code now. Worth a look, just for the spectacle!<br>
        <p align="left">Implemented strategies so far, are: </p>
        <ul>
     	<li> use of lists of available external proxies which are accessible
 on  ports  which are not blocked to the user (usually non-standard port
HTTP  proxies) 	</li>
      <li> use of lists of available external TCP/IP bouncers (redirectors, 
 relays,  ...) accessible on ports not blocked to the user, usually on shell 
 accounts  	</li>
      <li> use of lists of local proxies which are insecurely configured
to  allow  creation of tunnels via CONNECT to external proxies/services on
ports  which would be otherwise  blocked (port 80, 3128, 8080, 119 etc.)
	</li>
      <li> use of various URL encoding mechanisms to evade regexp based censoring
  (many of these are from Rain Forest Puppy's Whisker).</li>
      <li>use of &nbsp;various CGI proxies (which need not rewrite links).</li>
          <li>fragmentation of the URL request over TCP packets.        
 </li>
                           
        </ul>
Possible future strategies:                         
        <ul>
     	<li>built-in Socks 4, 5 (LP is already able to abstract an external 
Socks  proxy to provide an accessible, localhost Socks4 proxy) 	</li>
      <li> SSL</li>
      <li>Triangle Boy client<br>
      </li>
                           
        </ul>
        <h3>statProxy</h3>
A tool to test various aspects of a proxy's function to allow a user  to
determine it's usefulness for his purposes. It scans ports on  the proxy
if required, tests for CONNECT tunneling capability, censoring, anonymity,
speed, Socks capability etc. The output format is suitable for use by 'mergeHosts'
to merge these test results into the hosts database automatically.      
                   
        <h3>sortProxy</h3>
A simple sort and merge utility for lists of hosts. A fast, parallel DNS
 forward and reverse lookup is done on each entry to produce a standard 
format  output. Dupes are recognized by IP address and removed. The output
format  is suitable for piping to both findProxy or statProxy.          
               
        <h3>findProxy</h3>
This tool scans web pages, local files, bulletin boards, mailing lists  etc.
  for likely looking proxy entries and tests them. This uses LWP,  so it's
 slower than statProxy (which uses socket level code).  It's useful for it's
 extensive proxy entry recognition ability  (roughly done with Perl regexps)
 and it's final test for censoring  by the tested proxies.              
           
        <h3>master</h3>
This tool is intended to analyze the user's network environment and  produce
  an XML configuration file for use by the other tools to aid  the user in
 choices of proxies and strategies. The firewall rules are analyzed by direct
 testing, DNS servers are verified, localhost Internet interface IP address
 is established and confirmed and all is written to the configuration file
 for use by localProxy at build time. All operations are done in portable
ways.                          
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p align="left">The reason for going public with these tools is to 
ensure a wide  distribution to those in need, and to elicit ideas, and comments,
   from the networking community. These tools have been completely developed
in an environment consisting of myself (network/proxy consultant) and a group
of naive users. It is likely that the Internet community would be able to
add new perspectives to the project.</p>
        <p align="left">Comments and feature suggestions, as well as code, 
are welcome here.  </p>
