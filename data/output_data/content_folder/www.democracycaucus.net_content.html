<p>The Campaign for a United Nations Democracy Caucus is dedicated to the promotion and fulfillment of the principles of democracy and human rights embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Warsaw Declaration of the Community of Democracies. Towards that end, the Campaign seeks the permanent establishment of a UN Democracy Caucus as a group of democratic nations committed to strengthening the UN&rsquo;s ability to promote democracy and human rights. The Campaign is particularly focused on the composition and activities of the UN Commission on Human Rights and the Economic and Social Council, as well as decisions made by the UN General Assembly and Security Council.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In June 2000, over 100 governments gathered at the first Community of Democracies meeting in Warsaw and pledged to form caucuses at international and regional institutions to support resolutions and other international activities aimed at the promotion of democratic governance.</p>

<p>In October 2000, the first effort was made at the UN to convene a gathering of states participating in the Community of Democracies (CD) process. Some sixty states sent representatives to the meeting. Later that year, with the active support of those states, the UN General Assembly approved a landmark Resolution on Promoting and Consolidating Democracy (Res A/55/96).</p>

<p>Building on this momentum, a coalition of NGOs convened by the Democracy Coalition Project, Freedom House and Transnational Radical Party began to urge the formal creation of a Democracy Caucus at the United Nations. Through direct appeals to the Community of Democracies Convening Group and other official bodies, as well as outreach to other interested civil society groups, parliamentarians and the media, the Campaign for a UN Democracy Caucus has made significant progress toward its goals. Notably, in September 2004, the first formal meeting of the Democracy Caucus&rsquo;s foreign ministers, chaired by Chile, was held at the UN General Assembly, followed by first-ever meetings at the permanent representative and expert staff levels.</p>

<p>We invite you to join us in this endeavor, in your individual or organizational capacity, as we encourage the UN&rsquo;s democracies to take the lead in revitalizing the world body to fufill the vision of becoming a universal community of democracies.</p>

<h2>reation of UN Democracy Caucus Urged</h2>

<div>
<p>The democratic member states of the United Nations should use the just convened session of the UN Commission on Human Rights to create a permanent democracy caucus at the world body, a group of eminent persons from 28 countries urged in a statement released today.</p>

<p>The Commission on Human Rights today began its 60th annual session in Geneva.</p>

<p>In a written appeal to the foreign ministers of the Community of Democracies (COD), the group, composed of legislators and civil society representatives, urged that democracies unite to establish a democracy caucus at the United Nations.</p>

<p>The statement was circulated by a coalition of nongovernmental organizations, including Freedom House, the Democracy Coalition Project and the Transnational Radical Party.</p>

<p>The Community of Democracies, created in June 2000, unites over 100 democratically elected governments. It seeks to enhance cooperation among democratic states, to deepen respect for human rights and democracy, and to support fragile emerging democracies. In September 2003, foreign ministers from the Community of Democracies pledged to work to establish caucuses at regional and international bodies.</p>

<p>&quot;As yet, the group has not established a permanent working presence at the UN,&quot; said Adrian Karatnycky, Freedom House Counselor and a coordinator of the NGO effort to build a democracy caucus at the UN. &quot;As a first step, we urge that a Democracy Caucus should be established in Geneva during the current 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which convened today for six weeks of deliberations.&quot;</p>

<p>Of the 53 member states of the current UN Commission on Human Rights, 32 are members of the Community of Democracies. This means that countries with shared democratic practices represent a clear majority of states on the Commission.</p>

<p>The appeal calls on the COD to now follow through on its pledges. It was presented by the Campaign for UN Reform, the Council for a Community of Democracies, the Open Society Institute&#39;s Democracy Coalition Project, Freedom House, Human Rights Watch, the International League for Human Rights, and the Transnational Radical Party.</p>

<p>The caucus would be based on the Warsaw Declaration of the Community of Democracies, signed in June 2000, which calls for democracies to &quot;collaborate on democracy-related issues in existing international and regional institutions.&quot; The Community of Democracies reiterated this pledge in Seoul, Korea in 2002 when it charged the Convening Group with &quot;encouraging the formation of coalitions and caucuses to support democracy.&quot;</p>

<p>Freedom House is an independent watchdog organization that supports democratic change, monitors the status of freedom around the world, and advocates for democracy and human rights.</p>

<h2><strong>Principles and Activities</strong></h2>

<p>Participation in the Democracy Caucus is open only to countries that are invited to be full participants in the Community of Democracies process. The Community of Democracies maintains rigorous standards of membership and only includes states elected on the basis of competitive multiparty democratic elections and respectful of fundamental human rights.</p>

<h2><strong>We believe:</strong></h2>

<p>1. The broad purpose of the UN Democracy Caucus is to promote the values of democracy and human rights through the UN system.<br />
2. A related purpose of the UN Democracy Caucus is to strengthen the governance and accountability of the UN on issues of democracy and human rights promoting a democratic consciousness in decision-making on candidacies for key UN bodies.<br />
3. The UN Democracy Caucus should seek status akin to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, la Francophonie, and other like bodies.<br />
4. The UNDC should convene to coordinate actions to strengthen international support for member states in deepening democratic governance and reinforcing the protection of human rights and democratic values through the UN system and the UN&rsquo;s related agencies.<br />
5. The UNDC should focus on building international consensus on issues related to democracy and human rights at the UN and on building consensus among the UN&rsquo;s democracies in effectively utilizing the machinery of the UN system to assist in promoting democratic governance in states where the UN finds that egregious, systemic violations of human rights have frustrated democratization.<br />
6. The UNDC should promote increased resources for human rights and democracy building initiatives within the UN and within the UN system.</p>

<h2><strong>Organization of the UN Democracy Caucus</strong></h2>

<p>The Campaign for a UN Democracy Caucus believes that participation in the Democracy Caucus should be open only to countries that are invited to be full participants in the Community of Democracies process. The Community of Democracies membership includes states which are elected on the basis of competitive multiparty democratic elections and respectful of fundamental human rights. It excludes, according to its own criteria adopted in the Seoul Plan of Action, those states &ldquo;where there is currently a disruption of constitutional rule or severe persistent erosion of or lack of essential elements of democracy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The UN Democracy Caucus is convened by the current Chair of the Community of Democracies Convening Group - Chile - in cooperation with other members of the current Convening Group - Czech Republic, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Mali, South Africa, United States, Portugal, India, and Poland. The Campaign is in favor of official recognized UN status for the Democracy Caucus, on the same basis as the G-77, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, la Francophonie or the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.</p>

<p>The Democracy Caucus should convene to discuss common approaches on issues directly related to democracy and human rights. It should meet at the UN General Assembly as necessary, but no less than once a year during the annual meeting of the UNGA, including at the Foreign Ministers level. The members of the UNDC should also convene at:</p>

<p>A. ECOSOC and its relevant subcommittees and subsidiary bodies;<br />
B. Relevant meetings/seminars organized by the UN High Commissioner<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for Refugees;<br />
C. Meetings/seminars of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights;<br />
D. The UN Development Program;<br />
E. UNESCO.</p>

<p>Members of the UNDC have begun and should continue coordination at the annual meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. The Permanent Representatives of Convening Group governments (or their designated representatives) should meet as necessary to prepare materials and discuss agenda items related to the above functions.</p>

<h2>A caucus of democracies for the UN</h2>

<p>By ADRIAN KARATNYCKY and MATTEO MECACCIJAN. 1, 2005 | ww.nytimes.com</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><br />
<img alt="" src="/images/unitednations-exterior.jpg" style="width: 572px; height: 360px;" /></p>

<p><strong>NEW YORK &mdash;&nbsp;</strong>One of the most common accusations against the United Nations is that a coalition of tyrannies stifles decisive action on issues related to basic liberties.</p>

<p>Now things may be changing. Under the leadership of Chile, a group of countries including the United States, South Korea, Poland, Portugal, Mali and India have begun serious efforts to establish a UN Democracy Caucus to promote the values of human rights and democracy.</p>

<p>Free societies now make up nearly half the UN&#39;s membership, but they have rarely worked cohesively. At the UN Human Rights Commission, even the mildest criticisms of massive rights violations are blocked, while independent human rights organizations are often threatened with suspension or expulsion.</p>

<p>In May, the UN elected Sudan to the UN Human Rights Commission even as its government was in the midst of a murderous campaign of genocide. The year before, Libya, then still under one of the world&#39;s most repressive dictatorships, was selected to head the human rights commission. While Israel is subjected to numerous condemnatory resolutions each year, terrorist suicide bombings are rarely condemned, and countries such as China, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia regularly escape criticism or investigations.</p>

<p>This dismal record appears, finally, to be spurring action. On Sept. 22, the UN&#39;s largest gathering of democracies was held under the leadership of Chile&#39;s foreign minister, Maria Soledad Alvaer. Alvaer, who recently stepped down from her government post and is a likely presidential candidate in her country&#39;s next election, has pressed the idea of the Democracy Caucus, backed by energetic support from U.S. leaders, including Secretary of State Colin Powell and the outgoing U.S. ambassador to the UN, John Danforth.</p>

<p>The UN Development Program has also begun to address such formerly taboo issues as the lack of democracy in the developing world, producing a series of hard-hitting reports on the democracy deficit in the Arab world and promoting a model of sustainable economic development that goes hand in hand with democratic reform.</p>

<p>All these are harbingers of a serious effort to reclaim the UN for democratic values and democracy. But serious obstacles remain.</p>

<p>First, the UN&#39;s regional structure means that democracies predominate in several regional bodies (notably, the Western and Other Group and the Latin American Group), but are minorities in others. This is significant because the selection of candidates to key UN bodies is determined by nominations at the regional level.</p>

<p>One way around this regional democracy divide is to encourage more democracies from Asia and Africa to compete for posts in key UN bodies whose mandates include civil society, rights and democracy.</p>

<p>Another problem is the European Union. With the exception of Italy and Portugal, most EU support for the Caucus comes from Central European states like the Czech Republic and Poland. Key countries like France, Britain and Germany will need to be more engaged in urging multilateral cooperation among democratic countries.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a danger that the UN Democracy Caucus will be paralyzed if it operates on the basis of absolute consensus and allows one country or a small handful of countries to block hard-hitting statements and policies.</p>

<p>None of these challenges, however, is insurmountable. With liberal democratic states accounting for 89 percent of global GDP, they have enough clout to press the UN in more constructive directions. If they succeed over time, they will help deepen U.S. support for international cooperation. And they will achieve an ambition that Secretary General Kofi Annan proclaimed before NGO leaders in June 2000: to make the UN itself a community of democracies.</p>

<p>The Campaign for a UN Democracy Caucus monitors the voting records of governments before various bodies within the UN system, with special attention to resolutions before the UN Commission on Human Rights, the Economic and Social Council, the General Assembly and the Security Council. An examination of recent voting records of both democracies and non-democracies demonstrates that on key resolutions in these bodies, non-democracies exhibit much greater solidarity against country specific resolutions than democratic governments. The analysis graphically illustrates the need for a Democracy Caucus as a coalition to coordinate common positions on resolutions and other activities to protect democracy and human rights.</p>

<p><strong>Democracy Coalition Project releases Human Rights Council Report Card: Government Positions on Key Issues 2006-2007</strong></p>

<p>The Democracy Coalition Project has released an independent analysis of government performance during the first year of the new UN Human Rights Council entitled &ldquo;Human Rights Council Report Card: Government Positions on Key Issues 2006-2007.&rdquo; The analysis charts the positions of governments on key proposals related to insititutional reforms and country specific situations of major concern to the human rights community. The conclusions of the report underscore the need to develop cross-regional coalitions in order to build a credible and vigorous UN human rights system. The report is designed to help human rights advocates as they pursue strategies to strengthen the Council&#39;s attention to serious human rights issues; it will also help them evaluate how governments measure up as candidates for election of new Council members. DCP plans to publish these report cards on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p><strong>Democracies Secure UN Censure of Worst Human Rights Violators</strong></p>

<p>The UN General Assembly&#39;s Third Committee adopted four key country resolutions despite efforts by spoiler states to end the practice of naming and shaming the worst violators, according to a new survey by the Democracy Coalition Project. The survey, released on 11th December 2006 to commemorate the 58th Anniversary of the adoption of the UN Declaration on Human Rights, analyzes the voting patterns of UN Member States at the 61st General Assembly of the United Nations. The analysis is based on a scorecard that records the voting on five country resolutions condemning human rights abuses in selected states; it also covers a sixth resolution introduced by Belarus and Uzbekistan which sought to undermine the importance of country-specific resolutions. The study showed that efforts to block UN censure of human rights violators had failed, with members of the UN Democracy Caucus voting overwhelmingly for the four country resolutions that succeeded. The scorecards also showed a poor record by leading members of the Community of Democracies, including members of its Convening Group.</p>

<p><strong>Democracy Coalition Project releases Scorecard of Voting Patterns at the 3rd Committee of the 60th General Assembly of the United Nations</strong></p>

<p>The Democracy Coalition Project has carried out a study on the voting patterns of UN Member States at the 60th General Assembly of the United Nations. The analysis is based on a scorecard that records the voting on the seven country resolutions condeming Human Rights abuses in specific states that were presented to the General Assembly&#39;s 3rd Committee in the Fall of 2005. Six of the seven resolutions were approved, a trend that shows an increase in censure of Human Rights violations by the international community.</p>

<p><strong>Democracy Coalition Project releases Scorecard of Voting Patterns at the 2005 UN Commission on Human Rights</strong></p>

<p>Following the 2005 UN Commission on Human Rights the Democracy Coalition Project prepared a scorecard on the voting patterns of Community of Democracies and non-Community of Democracies countries. The scorecard was released with the NGO Coalition&#39;s latest appeal and was sent to the Permanent Representatives to the UN of Community of Democracies countries to further illustrate the need for their support of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan&#39;s proposal to reform the UN Human Rights System.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis Of Voting Patterns Of UNDC Countries Shows Mixed Results At 59th UNGA</strong></p>

<p>On January 10, 2005 the Democracy Coalition Project (DCP) released an analysis and scorecard of the voting patterns of members of the UN Democracy Caucus (UNDC) on key country resolutions at the 59th UN General Assembly. The results of the analysis show that there is little consensus among UNDC members to condemn even some of the worst violators of human rights, as some democratic governments continue to prioritize regional or north/south alliances when casting votes.</p>

<p>DCP&rsquo;s assessment illustrates the inclination among democratic regimes not to vote as a unified bloc for resolutions critical of human rights violations, but instead to continue to vote along regional and sub-regional lines. Non-democratic regimes, on the other hand, remain united against any move to erode the principle of &ldquo;non-intervention in sovereign affairs,&rdquo; regardless of the severity of the documented abuses against innocent civilians.</p>

<p><strong>European Legislation:</strong><br />
On February 24th, 2005 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on its priorities for the 61st UN Human Rights Commission. Included in the text of the resolution is an endorsement of establishing criteria for membership to the Human Rights Commission</p>

<p><strong>United States Legislation:</strong><br />
In November, 2003 Senator Joseph Biden introduced Senate Concurrent Resolution 83: A concurrent resolution promoting the establishment of a&nbsp;<strong>democracy caucus</strong>&nbsp;within the United Nations. This bill urges the President to instruct any U.S. representative to a United Nations (UN) body to use the voice and vote of the United States to seek to establish a&nbsp;<strong>democracy caucus</strong>&nbsp;within the UN.</p>

<p>The bill endorses limiting participation in the&nbsp;<strong>caucus</strong>&nbsp;to countries that are qualified to participate in the&nbsp;<strong>Community of Democracies</strong>&nbsp;and have demonstrated a commitment to specified democratic principles and practices.<br />
This bill was passed in the Senate unanimously on June 24, 2004.<br />
In March, 2004 Representatives Tom Lantos (D-CA) and David Dreier (R-CA) introduced HR 4053: International Leadership Act. This bill directs the President, through the Secretary of State, to support creation of a democracy caucus at the United Nations and other UN bodies.<br />
The bill states that a democracy caucus at an international organization should: (1) forge common positions on matters of concern before the organization and work within and across regional lines to promote agreed positions; (2) work to revise an increasingly outmoded system of regional voting and decision making; and (3) set up a rotational leadership scheme to provide member states an opportunity, for a set period of time, to serve as the designated president of the caucus, responsible for serving as its voice in each organization.<br />
A compromise version of these two bills was adopted by the House and the Senate as part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act signed into law in December 2004. One element of the compromise version is to reform the membership and leadership criteria at UN bodies and other international organizations using the following guidelines:&nbsp;</p>

<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where appropriate, reform the criteria for leadership and, in appropriate cases, for membership, at all United Nations bodies and at other international organizations and multilateral institutions to which the United States is a member so as to exclude countries that violate the principles of the specific organization;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make it a policy of the United Nations and other international organizations and multilateral institutions of which the United States is a member that a member country may not stand in nomination for membership or in nomination or in rotation for a significant leadership position in such bodies if the member country is subject to sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council; and<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work to ensure that no member country stand in nomination for membership, or in nomination or in rotation for a significant leadership position in such organizations, or for membership on the United Nations Security Council, if the government of the member country has been determined by the Secretary of State to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.</p>
