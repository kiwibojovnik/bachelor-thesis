<p>“Today, November 20, 2011 is the 13th Annual Transgender Day of Remembrance. We take this day every year to memorialize the people who have lost their lives due to anti-transgender violence. This violence and hatred is the result of society portraying transgender people as being worth less than other people, and as objects to be erased. </p>
<p>The only way to combat this violence is to get society see us as human beings with family and loved ones, dreams and aspirations, and not as objects. The Transgender Day of Remembrance is our opportunity to make this statement in solidarity with transgender people across the world, and to make sure that our fallen brothers and sisters are not forgotten. </p>
<p>We will not be erased.” –Denise Leclair, IFGE Executive Director</p>

    <p>January 8, 2010 - Washington DC</p>
<p>The International Foundation for Gender Education is calling on David Letterman to apologize for a defamatory skit that ran this week on the Late Show. On the program, Mr. Letterman announced President Barack Obama's appointment of Amanda Simpson to serve a national security role in the Commerce Department as Senior Technical Adviser. The show's announcer, Alan Kalter, ran offstage in a panic when Mr. Letterman stated that Ms. Simpson was transgender, implying that he had had a sexual relationship with her, and that she had deceived him.</p>

We welcome applications for participation in the Provider Day Poster session.  Poster presenters will receive a discount off the full registration fee.<BR /><br />

Seminars for the main Capital Conference will be held April 23rd-24th with a theme of “Education for Action; Knowing Yourself, Knowing Your Community and Committing to Action”.  This component is targeted towards the broader transgender community.  The Capital Conference may address gender related issues, emerging ‘trends’ and triumphs in the community, the politics related to gender issues, and other issues of interest. We are also interested in cross-disciplinary contributions from related fields such as medical professionals, mental health providers, researchers and educators of gender studies. Seminar sessions are typically 75 to 90 minutes and may be conducted by one or more speakers or another format as suggested by the submitter. It can present a case study, how to, big idea, theoretical discussion, new topic, a new way of looking at an existing topic, or other material.

    <p>October 28, 2009 – Washington, D.C.<BR /><br />
Culminating years of effort by leaders across the nation, President Barack Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law in a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House. This is the first federal law to specifically protect transgender people, adding protections for <b>gender, gender identity, disability and sexual orientation</b> to the 1969 Hate Crime Act, which already covered race, color, religion and national origin. <BR /><br />
<BR /><br />
"Transgender people have lived in fear far too long," said Denise Leclair, executive director of the International Foundation for Gender Education (IFGE). "When we are repeatedly targeted with acts of violence, we are deprived of the basic rights and freedoms that other people take for granted. This law sends a clear signal that we deserve, and are entitled to equal protection."<BR /><BR /></p>
